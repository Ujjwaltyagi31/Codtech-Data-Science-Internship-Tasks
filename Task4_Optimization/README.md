# üìä Task 4 ‚Äì Optimization Model: Resource Allocation using Linear Programming | CodTech Data Science Internship

This project solves a **real-world resource allocation problem** using **Linear Programming (LP)** with the `PuLP` library in Python.

---

## üìå Objective

To determine the **optimal number of units to produce** for two products (A & B) in a factory setting, in order to **maximize total profit**, while considering limited machine hours as constraints.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

A company produces two products:

| Product     | Machine 1 (hrs) | Machine 2 (hrs) | Profit per Unit |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Product A   | 2                | 1                | ‚Çπ30             |
| Product B   | 1                | 1                | ‚Çπ20             |

- **Machine 1** is available for **100 hours**
- **Machine 2** is available for **80 hours**

### üéØ Goal:  
Maximize profit while staying within machine hour constraints.

---

## üßÆ Linear Programming Formulation

**Decision Variables:**
- `x`: Units of Product A
- `y`: Units of Product B

**Objective Function (Maximize):**  
`30x + 20y`

**Subject to Constraints:**
- `2x + y ‚â§ 100` (Machine 1)
- `x + y ‚â§ 80` (Machine 2)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python
- [PuLP ‚Äì Linear Programming Library](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/)
- Optional: Matplotlib (for visualization)

## üìÅ Files Included

| File Name                | Description                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `optimization_model.py` | Python script for LP model                |
| `README.md`              | Documentation for Task 4                  |

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install pulp
2. Run the optimization script:
   ```bash
   python optimization_model.py

    ```

   ---

## ‚úÖ Output Example
   
Produce 20 units of Product A
Produce 60 units of Product B
Maximum Profit: ‚Çπ1800

---

## üìà Insights
The model helps identify the most profitable production strategy within resource limits.

Easily adaptable to more complex real-world supply chain or manufacturing scenarios.
